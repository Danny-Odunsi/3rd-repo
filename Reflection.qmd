I must say, this has been an incredibly insightful module. It is like nothing I ever dreamed I would be doing at any point in life, so it is a major achievement for me to be able to say that I have produced my own website.

This journey has not come without its challenges. Learning to read HTML and CSS was not an easy feat for me. Additionally, it required me to become very familiar with the lecture material. It took a lot of study and concentration in lectures and by myself. However, it has provided the ground work for the website that I have been able to submit.
