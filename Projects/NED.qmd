In this module, we were tasked (as groups of 5) to generate an idea for a fully-fledged, profitable business. It took place over the course of 8 months, in which we were required to complete a preliminary business plan, Feasfibility Study, Marketing Video & campaign and a pitch to a group of esteemed entrepreneurs.

Our idea? We formulated a plan to produce an inventory management software targeted at small businesses.
