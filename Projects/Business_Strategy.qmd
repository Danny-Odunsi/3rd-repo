Over the course of my final year, this module has been full of interesting learning curves.

My favourite project was the written group project, where myself and my team conducted a strategic review and gave strategic recommendations for Keogh's Farms, a well-known Irish crisps company. This is an assignment that honed my analytical, digital and communicative skills.

Have a look at our submission, which very narrowly missed out on a first class grade:
