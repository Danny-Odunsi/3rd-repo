Boxing, bartending and football are near and dear to my heart.

## Boxingü•ä

My roles as Public Relations Officer and later Vice Chairman of DCU Boxing Club have presented me with a host of interesting challenges and opportunities for creativity.

I was the first person in the club's history to produce club tracksuits, which are now open for order for members of the club.

With the help of my teammates, I produced a 'Technique Tuesday' series, in which I teach beginners the fundamental principals of boxing.

I have also competed in multiple boxing events, representing DCU against other boxing clubs.
